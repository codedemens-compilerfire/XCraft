### Preface

This book is written by me (Dawid), but it's more inspired set of my own personal thoughts rather than the robustly copied, or comprehensed from the books that exist, but regardless, I want to focus on the constieniousness aspect of writing. I don't know if I'm going to be efficient at it, it's my first attempt. 

I would like to develop this video game, and I want to be my best video game I would like to develop. In this regards, I would like to robustly focus on the both the video game source code, and documentation process. I want to focus on the applicables in the contieniousness (comprehensive) manner.

### Personal Prompt: Reading Comprehension, Writing Process, Cognitive Efficiency
Importantly, I want to focus on the definition of the constieniousness, Reading Comprehension, and how they derivative toawrds the development (software engineering) process.

## Process
### Priming Command
Priming is predominantly top-down control focus, in order to accomodate abstract-oriented goal. This switch, the decision-making process, which holds multiple elements at the same time, is originated in the prefrontal cortex. Proper priming is required for the initialization of the work process. Taking a pause before a goal orientation, and ideally constraining this goal orientation towards pro-active channel (the daily discipline) is at least suboptimal experience. The perfection doesn't exist, but fostering the positive growth is always adaptable. 

### Spacial Learning
Spacial learning is similar in principles to studying mathematics. Spacial learning help us to grow the Temporal Lobe of the brain. Thus, when developing a video game we could engage our minds into given spacial training, or originate some kind of discipline that can help us achieve this specific goal

### Engagement
Engagement with the goal orientation, means, that we pro-actively take steps in the disciplined approach, and we engage more and more scope of the work, or perfect it in the given domain (Deliberate Practice). Motivation stem from the personal needs to grow. Engagement can also mean, that we can expand upon our goals. It's also good to remain steady with the goal orientation we, in general recognize, and acknowledge. Organization of the tasks, systems, dutifulness, and cleanliness, next to pro-active motivation, drive, the juice, is important to maintain.

### Focus of the mind
In general, the focus of the mind should be in approaching the scopes that are worked upon. These aspects should be expanded upon, and trained in a very specific manner. First, the focus should be constrained (in deep work block; deliberate practice), and should be also cognitively engaged. We can look at other things in order to increase our cognitive effort, or to even retent (memorize) the knowledge. But more importantly, we should also access the appropriate (applicable) references on how to do given thing.

### Alike Enneagram 5w6 Programmer
This is a more subjective opinion of mine, but I believe that intervention, and detached goal orientation is better than robust, attributive goal orientation (i.e. statements "I'm going to write up to 1000 lines of code up until tomorrow" rather that "I'm going to write (exactly) 756 lines code today")

The enneagram theory of enneagram 5 says, that in order for the enneagram 5w6 to become healthy, is to be more spontaneous in the approach, and using the grouped knowledge in a "enough expert" way, that current given knowledge is enough for the first action-taking and we shouldn't setup overly rigid rule-taking. In a sense, we can goal orient, but better we trouble-shoot what's already in front of our face.

#### Placeholding
It's a good idea to setup placeholders where given work should be expanded upon, and where to work on through the given cognitive work. By setting up placeholders, where to work upon what, and to what extent. This "to what extent" is very important in the robust routine, mainly, because it constrains but also allows us to develop this routine in the enneagram 5w6 alike manner. Thus, placeholding the given area of the work, and the extent of the work, we can develop properly the given work parts in the given future-forth timeframe.

#### Self-Confirmation of the efficiency
This one may be one of the most important issues. We must not abandon the productive ways, we must setup robust Deep Work blocks where we work. Or, more, may it apply, to me? Nevertheless, self-confirming of how much one has done in the given timeframe, and focusing forward, to do even more, is important in the self-efficacy and self-discipline manner. We must feel that we're going forward, toward the future, for the given applicable, positive, goal orientation.

In this regards, we should focus 

### Iterative Process (Scientific method)
We should treat our work routine as iterative, scientific process. The given appropriation of the knowledge, and the appropriate system setup for the work discipline, should guide us in the given approach. The iterative process is here to incrementally improve the objective measurement of the results. Iterative process; scientific method can also mean proper standarization of the work effort, meaning, that it is a bridge, effectively bridging the gaps, of what's known and what is supposed; hypothesis

### The Beginner's mind, and craftmanship
Every session during programming has to start with beginner's mind, and craftmanship (mastery). It means that when approaching the work, one has to remain open in experience of the programming. This has to be based on the premise of the empathy. This means that the source code should be expanded upon, standards reinforced and maintained, proper authoritative control of the source code (the source maintance), as well as approprieation of the given tasks and expansions. If a major module is developed, one has to treat all the followed principles, previously mentioned, and the change in the major modules has to be treated in the work recursively, back-and-forth, and through analysis and approprieation. 

Craftmanship on the other hand dictates, that the given mastery over something has to be maintained and applied. There has to be some principle of growth factors applied. Therefore, the applicable stance of work, the appropriation of the tools, and robust documentation process has to be applied.

### Big Dream

### Deliberate Practice
Deliberate Practice dictates for us, that each perfected step of the skill takes a great block of effort, and it increases only to some extent. In this regards, the endurativeness nature of the work many times, if not most of the times outperform the perfectionism based, rigid-rules framework of such. Deliberate Practice thus has to be maintained only to perfect our skillset. And we must understand that there are only a given sets of skills, and these, are to be trained like back-and-forth, in order to increase our capacity for intelligence.

### One thing - working in the universal principle
One thing, for instance, a function, a class, a struct, enum class, etc. is responsible for one thing in particular, in the universal principle. One thing has to be perfectly documented, has to be in place, has to have it's hierarchy, and the given code so that it's so universally coherent, that it allows to be applicable in every context. Moreover, it has to be tested, meaning, that given source code is applicable when it passes the unit test, or the realtime testing.

### About Psychological Resillience
Psychological Resillience has to be maintained throughout the work process. There are many processes that can disrupt the concentration over the project, and psychological resilience is a channel upon which one can increase one's own effort. It means that over the given facade of possible cognition, psychological resilience acts as a antifragility principle. It allows to maintain the given focus, conserve (preserve) it

### Work with the artificial intelligence agent (i.e. Google Gemini)
I don't want to lie, but I prefer Google Gemini over ChatGPT predomintantely because of how Google Gemini presents the data, and it's not generating strange, artificial persuasive approach. 

But more importantly, I believe that the work routine should be created in a following way: Firstly, not the artificial intelligence should be asked, but rather, if one wants to find information about the given aspect, one should first use google search. It's not merely for the ecological or/and conservative purposes, but because there is already information available on the internet, and I believe in the ability to search the information on the internet as the one of the possible skills that there is. 

Secondly, and possibly even more importantly, the ability to generate an idea on one's own, and then adapting through own self-thinking process, is somewhat superior to programming using the agent which extends cognition, and offloads it to the scaffolding. 

Thirdly, we should develop a specific skills, which, incorporated with(in) our top-down approach, should be conserving our own experience (our ability to work-through the given works). We can extend our cognition, but this constrains or even limits the capacity upon which we can work ourselves on the given thing. Ideas/Knowledge generated out of our own brain are valuable more than those who stolen, or generated. (which is the same in the case of artificial intelligence)

This doesn't mean that the given resources should be valued, it's just that for resillience purposes we should train to be independent in our workset. That we should foster internal locus of control with regards to the productivity. This means expanding and self-discipline. (the efficiency, the way we motivate ourselves)

This also doesn't mean that AI shouldn't used. My first prototype of procedurally generated terrain in fact were generated by the AI. It's just that we should respect our way of programming through own cognition. We had already enough with regards to technology, that individuals decreased their focus, attention span to few seconds, where in the past it was minutes, on a given random online stimulu, and that many of the social medias (especially broad ones) are based on the engagement solely in the virtual sense, that we're not really engaging our cognitions but depleting it. Adding to this mix Artificial Intelligence - we must not only preserve our ability to focus (which means mindfulness, meditation, and healthy lifestyle choices, alongside with life skills and craftmanship), we must also act in according to craft, to the given tools - the way we are going to use tools in constienious mnanner.

### Detail-Orientation
Detail orientation is based on the given scope (i.e. algorithms, math, software development, software engineering, etc.), and I personally believe that own detail orientation towards the given algorithms (i.e. generating the ideas in one's own mind, and then applying them into the source code, alongside previously mentioned documentation) are best one can do when it comes to knowledge retention, and appropriation of the system of the video game source code.

### The Upmost Principle
We shouldn't hord information, tools, or principles, but also we should be approaching the given things with the certainty that these should be held with the given principles in mind. These principles, the moral axioms, should be stemming from the self-discipline, to distinguish them from the consequentialist/utilitarian frameworks, to the ethical values. This means, that the given system we are maintainer of, we are maintaning something that is for ethical, and not unethical stasis. This is important, because the given tool can be used in a way that's constructive, or in a way that's is not. This also refers to the video games.

Example of this is that addiction to video games can increase agression. Therefore, we should emplace, in a video, even as a tool, a mechanism, a comprehension, and appropriate guideliner, an authentic one, even in the source code, that guides through moral decision making. This is important, even more important than the constieniousness (productivity) itself.

### Automation
Work process should be automated. Meaning, that appropriate applications, IDE(s), tools should be available, and the given usage should be both documentated and automated

### Reading & Retention
I will personally try to read and retent the knowledge from the morning, during the day and before going to sleep. This way I'll try to memorize, knowledge retent on what I specifically work on. Alongside, I'm going to try to fix given things, in according to the constieniousness approaches, as well as in the flow states. This way I'm going to retent knowledge with regards to what I'm doing.

### Robust Organization
Organization has to be based on the three premises: 1. Current status of the code (How it is organized, what symbol has what status), 2. Expansion (How it can be improved, added upon), 3. Preservation (How the given source functions can be preverved upon). All of these three are in some sense relatable to each other. In same sense, such principles are applicable to this given document, but also other documents. In a sense, reading comprehension has to be maintainced

### Flow States & Deep Work States
Flow states and Deep Work states are applicable for the work in a way, that increases the ability to expand upon the work. These are the concepts in a sense, but flow states are very efficient in a sense, that allows to flow the positive emotions into the given channel of work. Deep Work States on the other hand are more robust, more appliable with, or relatable to Deliberate Practice routine. These three, have the ability to expand the work to the most expressive form. I have a dream to work upon this video game one year, but implement as many things as I possibly could, not abandoning any element in particular. Alikewise in the paraphaph I wrote about ethical system, I believe building helpful and positive community around the video game has the basis upon which it's worth to develop even such things as video games.

#### Deep Work Block
I'm highly advocating for a form of a discipline similar to which is available for writers. An isolated environment upon which a programmer codes given aspect, and the environment is also ascetic one, devoid of dopamine-seeking, and applicable with the training itself. Deep Work Blocks should be also conservative in some sense, they are possibly to be held in a manner that allows for conservation of the work, and also applicable toolset, mastery.

### Recovery
Alikewise in the flow states one has to recharge one's own battery in order to continue, the recovery towards the deliberate practice has to be based on the personal resilience. This personal resilience also should have the capacity to grow and expand, it should have the capacity to increase one's own capacity for the given work routine.

### Robust Discipline (Dutifulness in constieniousness)
Discipline is many times defined by some authors (especially within the self-help aglomerate/community) as the way to preservere the given aspect of work, within medium to long-term timespan. This aspect is also important in preservation of the work. The given, has to be based on the premise that you should make breaks (recovery) as concise as possible in the context of regeneration and further discipline orientation. This aspect is known as dutifulness facade in constieniousness (in the five-factor model of personality). So alongside the personal motivation (self-discipline), orderliness of the work, etc. there has to be timing in the given efficiency - Dutifulness

### Perfectionism
There are three major groups of perfectionism, and only one is considered adaptive. But I will argue that even self-oriented perfectionism (the one that is adaptive) is also not healthy form of perfectionism. Mainly because how it manifests in contrast to the trust dynamics. These three major groups of perfectionism are:

 - Self-Oriented Perfectionism (High standards towards oneself, joyful predisposition to unite other individuals)
 - Other-Oriented Perfectionism (Rigid, impossible to meet standards for others, associated with the Dark Triad Traits)
 - Socially Prescribed Perfectionism (Approach to overadhere to social rules, social games (Associated with low self-esteem))

Even though it may be counter-intuitive, the perfectionism should be subdued through the pro-active skills; Pro-active approach (life skills, cognitive skills) and psychological resillience. This must be approached the followed way mainly because perfectionism constricts the productivity, and the given rules to a given static self, that this static self shouldn't be changed and is a form of overt taboo. 

This means, for the expansive approach, that the principles should be applied in the open way, that the growth should be forward-looking and that given principles should be proactively trained, and that there is always a possibility of a better way of doing things.

#### No space for Dark Triad Behavior
There is no space for Dark Triad behavior. No expansion of the given rigid, unspoken rules, or overly abusive perfectionism. There is no space for trolling, or bullshitting, or any form of antisocial or passive-agressive behavior. These are also applying to me. Daily rehearsal of empathy, empathic listening, as well as psychotherapeutic crunches, in order to improve empathy, love, and compassion, are neccesary to foster positive connections with others. Moreover, I personally view that empathy is so essential for productivity, that it may be even more important than merely the constieniousness trait. Even if the latter is many times important for the productivity aspect in itself, empathy is important for love and connection. 

I'm aware that I may be pointing too much on the psychology-related aspects of the given, but I believe these are at upmost important and shouldn't be skipped, that's why I'm mentioning them. 

#### Social Media
There is this issue with social media that it fosters depression and anxiety, especially when is overused. That's why I believe we should build communities that are oriented on love and pro-activity. Social media hijack our attention span, it constrains the ability to function and makes us more focused on superstitious perfomance rather than true authentic growth approaches. That's why, I personally believe, that when using these technologies, given aspects of reality should be treated as informations, rather than axioms, mainly, because social media such as Facebook are rooted in general in a very specific vague form of engagement. There is a form of comparison that stem from overusage of Facebook.
