## Preface

This book is written by me (Dawid), but it's more inspired set of my own personal thoughts rather than the robustly copied, or comprehensed from the books that exist, but regardless, I want to focus on the constieniousness aspect of writing. I don't know if I'm going to be efficient at it, it's my first attempt. 

I would like to develop this video game, and I want to be my best video game I would like to develop. In this regards, I would like to robustly focus on the both the video game source code, and documentation process. I want to focus on the applicables in the contieniousness (comprehensive) manner.

### Personal Prompt: Reading Comprehension, Writing Process, Cognitive Efficiency
Importantly, I want to focus on the definition of the constieniousness, Reading Comprehension, and how they derivative toawrds the development (software engineering) process.

## Process
### The Beginner's mind, and craftmanship
Every session during programming has to start with beginner's mind, and craftmanship (mastery). It means that when approaching the work, one has to remain open in experience of the programming. This has to be based on the premise of the empathy. This means that the source code should be expanded upon, standards reinforced and maintained, proper authoritative control of the source code (the source maintance), as well as approprieation of the given tasks and expansions. If a major module is developed, one has to treat all the followed principles, previously mentioned, and the change in the major modules has to be treated in the work recursively, back-and-forth, and through analysis and approprieation. 

Craftmanship on the other hand dictates, that the given mastery over something has to be maintained and applied. There has to be some principle of growth factors applied. Therefore, the applicable stance of work, the appropriation of the tools, and robust documentation process has to be applied.

### One thing - working in the universal principle
One thing, for instance, a function, a class, a struct, enum class, etc. is responsible for one thing in particular, in the universal principle. One thing has to be perfectly documented, has to be in place, has to have it's hierarchy, and the given code so that it's so universally coherent, that it allows to be applicable in every context. Moreover, it has to be tested, meaning, that given source code is applicable when it passes the unit test, or the realtime testing.

### About Psychological Resillience
Psychological Resillience has to be maintained throughout the work process. There are many processes that can disrupt the concentration over the project, and psychological resilience is a channel upon which one can increase one's own effort. It means that over the given facade of possible cognition, psychological resilience acts as a antifragility principle. It allows to maintain the given focus, conserve (preserve) it
