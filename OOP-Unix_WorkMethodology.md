### Preface

This book is written by me (Dawid), but it's more inspired set of my own personal thoughts rather than the robustly copied, or comprehensed from the books that exist, but regardless, I want to focus on the constieniousness aspect of writing. I don't know if I'm going to be efficient at it, it's my first attempt. 

I would like to develop this video game, and I want to be my best video game I would like to develop. In this regards, I would like to robustly focus on the both the video game source code, and documentation process. I want to focus on the applicables in the contieniousness (comprehensive) manner.

### Personal Prompt: Reading Comprehension, Writing Process, Cognitive Efficiency
Importantly, I want to focus on the definition of the constieniousness, Reading Comprehension, and how they derivative toawrds the development (software engineering) process.

## Process
### The Beginner's mind, and craftmanship
Every session during programming has to start with beginner's mind, and craftmanship (mastery). It means that when approaching the work, one has to remain open in experience of the programming. This has to be based on the premise of the empathy. This means that the source code should be expanded upon, standards reinforced and maintained, proper authoritative control of the source code (the source maintance), as well as approprieation of the given tasks and expansions. If a major module is developed, one has to treat all the followed principles, previously mentioned, and the change in the major modules has to be treated in the work recursively, back-and-forth, and through analysis and approprieation. 

Craftmanship on the other hand dictates, that the given mastery over something has to be maintained and applied. There has to be some principle of growth factors applied. Therefore, the applicable stance of work, the appropriation of the tools, and robust documentation process has to be applied.

### One thing - working in the universal principle
One thing, for instance, a function, a class, a struct, enum class, etc. is responsible for one thing in particular, in the universal principle. One thing has to be perfectly documented, has to be in place, has to have it's hierarchy, and the given code so that it's so universally coherent, that it allows to be applicable in every context. Moreover, it has to be tested, meaning, that given source code is applicable when it passes the unit test, or the realtime testing.

### About Psychological Resillience
Psychological Resillience has to be maintained throughout the work process. There are many processes that can disrupt the concentration over the project, and psychological resilience is a channel upon which one can increase one's own effort. It means that over the given facade of possible cognition, psychological resilience acts as a antifragility principle. It allows to maintain the given focus, conserve (preserve) it

### Work with the artificial intelligence agent (i.e. Google Gemini)
I don't want to lie, but I prefer Google Gemini over ChatGPT predomintantely because of how Google Gemini presents the data, and it's not generating strange, artificial persuasive approach. 

But more importantly, I believe that the work routine should be created in a following way: Firstly, not the artificial intelligence should be asked, but rather, if one wants to find information about the given aspect, one should first use google search. It's not merely for the ecological or/and conservative purposes, but because there is already information available on the internet, and I believe in the ability to search the information on the internet as the one of the possible skills that there is. 

Secondly, and possibly even more importantly, the ability to generate an idea on one's own, and then adapting through own self-thinking process, is somewhat superior to programming using the agent which extends cognition, and offloads it to the scaffolding. 

Thirdly, we should develop a specific skills, which, incorporated with(in) our top-down approach, should be conserving our own experience (our ability to work-through the given works). We can extend our cognition, but this constrains or even limits the capacity upon which we can work ourselves on the given thing. Ideas/Knowledge generated out of our own brain are valuable more than those who stolen, or generated. (which is the same in the case of artificial intelligence)

This doesn't mean that the given resources should be valued, it's just that for resillience purposes we should train to be independent in our workset. That we should foster internal locus of control with regards to the productivity. This means expanding and self-discipline. (the efficiency, the way we motivate ourselves)

This also doesn't mean that AI shouldn't used. My first prototype of procedurally generated terrain in fact were generated by the AI. It's just that we should respect our way of programming through own cognition. We had already enough with regards to technology, that individuals decreased their focus, attention span to few seconds, where in the past it was minutes, on a given random online stimulu, and that many of the social medias (especially broad ones) are based on the engagement solely in the virtual sense, that we're not really engaging our cognitions but depleting it. Adding to this mix Artificial Intelligence - we must not only preserve our ability to focus (which means mindfulness, meditation, and healthy lifestyle choices, alongside with life skills and craftmanship), we must also act in according to craft, to the given tools - the way we are going to use tools in constienious mnanner.

### Detail-Orientation
Detail orientation is based on the given scope (i.e. algorithms, math, software development, software engineering, etc.), and I personally believe that own detail orientation towards the given algorithms (i.e. generating the ideas in one's own mind, and then applying them into the source code, alongside previously mentioned documentation) are best one can do when it comes to knowledge retention, and appropriation of the system of the video game source code.

### The Upmost Principle
We shouldn't hord information, tools, or principles, but also we should be approaching the given things with the certainty that these should be held with the given principles in mind. These principles, the moral axioms, should be stemming from the self-discipline, to distinguish them from the consequentialist/utilitarian frameworks, to the ethical values. This means, that the given system we are maintainer of, we are maintaning something that is for ethical, and not unethical stasis. This is important, because the given tool can be used in a way that's constructive, or in a way that's is not. This also refers to the video games.

Example of this is that addiction to video games can increase agression. Therefore, we should emplace, in a video, even as a tool, a mechanism, a comprehension, and appropriate guideliner, an authentic one, even in the source code, that guides through moral decision making. This is important, even more important than the constieniousness (productivity) itself.

### Automation
Work process should be automated. Meaning, that appropriate applications, IDE(s), tools should be available, and the given usage should be both documentated and automated

### Reading & Retention
I will personally try to read and retent the knowledge from the morning, during the day and before going to sleep. This way I'll try to memorize, knowledge retent on what I specifically work on. Alongside, I'm going to try to fix given things, in according to the constieniousness approaches, as well as in the flow states. This way I'm going to retent knowledge with regards to what I'm doing.
