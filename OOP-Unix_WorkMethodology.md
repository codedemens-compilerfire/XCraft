## Preface

This book is written by me (Dawid), but it's more inspired set of my own personal thoughts rather than the robustly copied, or comprehensed from the books that exist, but regardless, I want to focus on the constieniousness aspect of writing. I don't know if I'm going to be efficient at it, it's my first attempt. 

I would like to develop this video game, and I want to be my best video game I would like to develop. In this regards, I would like to robustly focus on the both the video game source code, and documentation process. I want to focus on the applicables in the contieniousness (comprehensive) manner.
