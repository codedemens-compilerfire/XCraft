## Compilation process on the Windows
Compilation process on the Windows 11 predominantly is able using the mingw32-make.exe, given, that the libraries applicable (SFML 2.6.3, ENet, Sol3) are built on the system. **The Video Game is available under the Creative Commons - CC BY 4.0 License**, meaning, that you are allowed to use the source code, given you give the approprieate reference to the authorship (which is also Google Gemini to some extent)

## Official Video Game Download (Launcher)
The official video game is available on the [https://compilerfire.com/XCraft] website. You can install it through the automated launcher (which is available in the src/launcher/ subfolder of this repository)

## Development Focus
Development focus is threefold. Firstly, the source code is compatible with both **Unix Programming Principles** and **Software Engineering Principles** (***such as Agile***), meaning, that the code requirements are both clean, and written objectively (Clean Code by Robert C. Martin), and also compatible with objective-oriented programming methodology. 

This is strictly robustly engineered by me. There are two major reasons why I pursued this in the followed way. Firstly, I would like to develop video game in a way, that is easy to be modified / added upon, and maintained. The Objective Oriented Programming Principles allow to preview the source code as if the clinical book. Secondly, the code can be possibly edited by other programmers or AI specifically, so that the given programming agent can see clearly through the architecture; content of the code.

## Documentation
Documentation is available under the [https://compilerfire.com/XCraft/Documentation](https://compilerfire.com/XCraft/Documentation) website. It is robustly updated and is available in the clean format.

## Development Diary / Discipline Process / Statistical Productivity
Development Diary, alongside the Discipline Process is available in the dev/ folder, and is going to be comprehensively documented. This process is graphically represented as calc, but I'm planning to visualilze the process using some kind of program.

*XCraft is developed by Dawid (Codedemens-Compilerfire) Jakubowski*, and the applicable code are written by Google Gemini, and him, with the emphasis focus on the *Software Engineering (Objective-Oriented Programming) and Unix Development Methodology*
