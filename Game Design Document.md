## Procedurally Generated Terrain
The Procedurally generated terrain is going to consist of 24 by 24 tiles, mainly, because this could be considered a good proportion for a tile. It's a proportion that is wide enough for the tiles to represent rich amount of innumerous tiles, and it's also neat, slick enough for the gameplay experience. With this regards I'm perfectionist.
